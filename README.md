# Extensions, Fixes and Patches for Fahrenheit
_(alternatively, Engine Fixes and Patches)_

This mod is home to an assortment of optional, but highly recommended fixes and patches for Final Fantasy X/X-2.

It can be considered the Fahrenheit analogue of the [USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266) for Skyrim - a set of foundational
fixes for the game that fixes long-standing subtle issues, or provides extensions for functionality you might not have known the game was capable of.

If your mod bundles a fix for some issue in the game, please consider removing it from your mod and submitting a pull request to integrate it to EFP instead,
as it will then be maintained and kept in sync with the Fahrenheit core by the project developers themselves.
